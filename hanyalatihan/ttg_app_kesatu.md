Let's build a mini TransformerLab-style app using Python that lets you:

🧠 Load and interact with an LLM (e.g. Mistral or GPT via API)

📊 View model responses and token usage

📝 Save chats and summaries in Markdown

🧪 Optionally test classification or regression models

We’ll use Gradio for the UI and LangChain or OpenAI/Groq API for the backend.

Let’s build Our LLM-powered ML Lab with all 7 features. I’ll walk you through a modular Python app using Gradio, Groq/OpenAI APIs, and scikit-learn for ML tasks. This will be a powerful bilingual, educational, and interactive tool—perfect for your workflow automation and student-friendly documentation goals.

🧠 Full Feature Breakdown
✅ 1. Classification & Regression Tabs
Use uploaded CSVs to train/test models like Logistic Regression or Linear Regression.

✅ 2. Model Selector
Dropdown to choose between GPT-3.5, Mistral (via Groq), Claude (via API if available).

✅ 3. Markdown Export
Save chat history or model results as .md files using Python’s markdown and datetime.

✅ 4. Eval Mode
Upload CSV, select target column, run classification or regression, and view metrics.

✅ 5. Bilingual Toggle
Switch UI and output between English and Indonesian using a simple toggle.

✅ 6. Memory Techniques
Embed mnemonics or visual aids (e.g. memory palace hints, emoji-based cues) for ML steps.

✅ 7. Groq/OpenAI Toggle
Choose backend provider dynamically for LLM responses.
